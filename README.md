This is a sip client using the 2 FXS ports available on routers based on the Infineon Danube (lantiq xway) and running openwrt.

**This is just a test to try and build it for openwrt 23.05.4, it works but
I'm still working on it.**

**The original repository, working with openwrt 19.07.2 is [here](https://github.com/olivluca/danube-voip).**

Based on the [midge](http://zftlab.org/pages/2014070600.html) package [oem-voip](https://github.com/ZigFisher/Midge/tree/master/package/oem-voip) and [sofia-sip](http://sofia-sip.sourceforge.net).

See the [INSTRUCTIONS](INSTRUCTIONS.md) for instructions.

Precompiled binaries for _attitude adjustment_, _barrier breaker_ and _chaos calmer_ are available [here](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0BwPmW2whNqGlcHVuUHd1Z2xWUjA&usp=sharing), binaries for openwrt 19.07.2 (and possibly later versions), are available as github [releases](https://github.com/olivluca/danube-voip/releases).
